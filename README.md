# 🎙️ AI-Powered Audio Classification & Intent Detection

In this project, I developed an **AI-powered audio classification system** that leverages **Deep Learning, NLP, and OpenAI’s Whisper model** to accurately transcribe and classify spoken language into predefined intents. This system can be used in **real-time applications** such as virtual assistants, customer service automation, and smart voice interfaces.

### **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
✅ **Whisper Model (OpenAI)** – Used for **speech-to-text conversion**, enabling high-accuracy transcription of spoken audio.  
✅ **NLP (Hugging Face Transformers)** – Applied to **intent classification**, where pre-trained transformer models process and categorize user input.  
✅ **Deep Learning (PyTorch)** – Fine-tuned the model to improve intent recognition based on speech context.  
✅ **Flask & FastAPI** – Built a real-time API to process user audio and return classified intents.

### **🔍 How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **User speaks into the system** – The microphone records the audio input.  
2️⃣ **Speech-to-Text Conversion (Whisper Model)** – Converts the raw audio into a structured text format.  
3️⃣ **Intent Classification (NLP Model)** – The text is processed using an **intent classification model** trained on diverse conversational data.  
4️⃣ **Real-Time Output** – The system returns the **transcription and detected intent** instantly.

### **🚀 Real-World Applications**  
🔹 **Customer Support Automation** – AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can understand and respond to user queries more accurately.  
🔹 **Healthcare & Virtual Assistance** – Enables speech-based assistance for scheduling, FAQs, and symptom-based guidance.  
🔹 **Smart Home & IoT** – Enhances **voice-controlled devices** to understand user commands effectively.  
🔹 **Call Center Optimization** – Automates **speech analytics** to classify and route customer service calls efficiently.

### **🌟 Key Highlights**  
🔹 **High Accuracy Speech-to-Text** – Whisper model ensures precise transcription, even in noisy environments.  
🔹 **Advanced NLP for Intent Recognition** – Uses **transformer-based models** for superior contextual understanding.  
🔹 **Scalable & Real-Time Processing** – Built with Flask/FastAPI for **quick deployment and seamless integration**.  
🔹 **Customizable & Domain-Specific** – Can be trained on different **industry-specific datasets** to improve accuracy.
